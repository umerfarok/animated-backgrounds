# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Interactive Mode**: Mouse and touch listeners stay attached when the animation, theme, or blend mode changes, and `interactionConfig` updates reach the live handler
- **Interaction Config**: `updateConfig` on an interaction handler now takes effect and no longer mutates the config object passed in
- **Theme Transitions**: `transitionToTheme` now finishes with the theme applied, accepts custom themes, and applies the theme at once when none is active
- **Animation Sequencer**: Importing keeps a track volume of `0`, and `batch` restores update notifications when an operation throws

### 🛠️ Technical Improvements
- **Tests**: Added a `node --test` suite that runs in CI on Node 22 and 24
- **Docs Deployment**: The docs workflow deploys with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of a personal token

## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-04

### 🐛 Fixed
